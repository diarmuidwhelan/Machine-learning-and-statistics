# Repository for GMIT Machine Learning and Statistics Project
# An analysis of Boston House Prices Oct 2019
# Project Goals
Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment.
Within the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset.
Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. 
You should explain and discuss your ﬁndings within the notebook.
Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.
